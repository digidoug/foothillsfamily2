	<title>Here there be Dragons...</title>
	<description>As parents, we all understand the draw of technology for our children. Indeed, modern youth often seem to spend more time on technology than in the “real world”. With the wide availability of connected devices like cell phones, computers, tablets, ChromeBooks and video game consoles it’s easy to see how our youth tend to “glue” themselves to screens. As adults, it can be difficult to understand how they spend their time. For example, one of the most popular genres of YouTube video consists of passively watching others play their favorite video games! 

 

The favoured way of communicating with their peers amongst teens seems to be through through SMS text messages and social media sites like SnapChat, Kik and Ask.FM. Many of us find we need to put restrictions on “screen time” to ensure that our children get enough sleep and are able to socially interact with others.  Research warns us of the dangers of this over abundance of screens.Uhls et. al (2014), for example found that the simple act of taking technology away from teens for the space of 5 days increased their ability to recognize facial expressions and nonverbal cues! Other harmful effects can include difficulty keeping up with homework (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2016) and even a difficulty making friends (Margalit, 2016)!

 

Wait… Isn’t this blog supposed to be about Hope and Opportunity?

 

For my own children, we work to ensure that screen time doesn’t become the primary way that they interact with the world. Our children have a limit on screen time and we strive to be aware of how that screen time is being used. We give our kids that daily “push” out the door for that all important fresh air. Most importantly we engage with our kids on how they use their online time... which brings me to my story.

 

A few weeks ago, as often happens, my teenage son had made it home from school before his mom and dad, and had chosen to spend this time on our computer. At the time, I was facilitating a collaborative session with a group of our teachers. My cell phone buzzed and the following text message appeared:



When I got home, rather than finding him watching his favorite YouTube channel, playing a game or watching Netflix, his cell phone was sitting on the desk with his friend on speaker-phone. They were using a free tool http://flat.io to write a musical score using its live, collaborative editing features.  Most significantly, this wasn’t even for school. They were composing music just for fun!  The idea was their own.  No teacher had posed the problem to them; neither had heard of flat.io prior to the project. Together, they had initiated the idea, searched for a tool that would help them realize it, and then just got to work!

 

What makes this fascinating is not that these two teens were creating and publishing an original work without being “assigned” the task by a teacher, instead it is that this practice isn’t that unusual for modern teens. For proof of this, all one has to do is take a quick glance at the most popular videos on YouTube. Most creators are teens or young adults and they’re reaching an audience of thousands! 

 

Youth today have grown up in a world where they have the ability to follow an idea from inception, to creation to publishing. Depending on where their personal strengths lie, our youth are creating and publishing images, original video, music, mobile apps and more!  If we pay attention to what they are viewing through these social media, we see that they are listening and watching other youth! They are using readily available tools to create and re-mix. They are creating “mashups” - the art of taking two forms of media like images and text or videos with different sound tracks - to share their beliefs, ideas and understandings of the world they live in. Likes and views have become the new social credit.

 

What does this tell us about student learning?

 

Factual content is no longer enough for our students. They live in a world where facts and multiple perspectives about those facts are merely a click or tap away. Our students are using technology to create and contribute content and their own perspectives. How then do we leverage this to engage them in our classrooms? How do we help them to uncover those learning outcomes through rich authentic tasks that use the technology to pose and solve worthwhile questions?

 

In Foothills, we have several strategies to support this work.  Our schools are moving away from classic libraries to learning commons - from passive sources of information to places where students have access to the spaces and tools that support these actions. Many of our schools have developed Maker Spaces (Hertz, 2012) that provide tools such as robotics, 3D Printers and other digital technologies to help students explore their own creativity.  Our learning commons facilitators have received training and support in these areas as well as in digital citizenship, digital copyright and online safety to support our students understanding of the opportunities and risks associated with their globalized world.

 

Our three year new teacher mentorship program supports our young teachers to build skills in the areas of designing authentic learning experiences, using assessment to inform instruction and using technology not only to remove barriers but also to create and contribute their own perspectives.

 

Provincially, our curriculum is beginning a shift towards a competencies driven model. In addition to the knowledge, skills and attitudes that constitute a comprehensive program of studies, current curriculum development intentionally supports our students to become:


	
	Critical Thinkers
	
	
	Communicators
	
	
	Problem Solvers
	
	
	Collaborators
	
	
	Managers of Information
	
	
	Cultural and Global Citizens
	
	
	Creators and Innovators
	
	
	Custodians of their own Personal Growth and Well-Being
	


 

Perhaps the question isn’t only how much time do our children spend online, but also how do our children spend their online time.  Food for thought.

 

Yours in learning,

Doug Stevens

	<title>Classroom Program Innovative Projects</title>
	<description>Foothills School Division Board of Trustees announced the distribution of $140,000 to grassroots learning opportunities.  This funding, part of the Board’s commitment of $1 million dollars over 5 years, will be used to support projects that will provide innovative and creative learning opportunities that will enhance student learning across the Division.

Board Chair Christine Pretty said, “We are excited to support projects that will enhance and improve excellence in student learning through creative practice and collaboration. We are looking forward to sharing these innovative projects and their results across the Division and with the community.”

Fourteen proposals have been approved during the December 21 Board meeting.  These projects will occur in 8 different schools spanning from elementary to high school.  They include such projects as building blended learning math portfolios, cross curricular film projects, school wide writing programs, outdoor education for intervention of at-risk students, a human library event, and project based learning on issues such as sustainability and water as well as math and sciences.

Pam Rannelli, Assistant Superintendent of Learning Services said, “It was inspiring to see the high caliber and innovative ideas and passion for education and learning that our teachers displayed in putting together these proposals”.

A full list of approved projects will be available in the coming weeks.

	<title>Annual Education Results Report</title>
	<description>Student learning and preparing our students for future success is at the very core of our work in Foothills School Division (FSD).

Our Three Year Education Plan (3YEP)/Annual Education Results Report (AERR) is online and available for you to read.  In it you will see that several overall measures related to student learning and achievement in FSD remained strong, or improved last year, according to provincial assessment results for the 2015-2016 school year. Among them: safe and caring schools; program of studies; high school completion rate; very low dropout rate; education quality; Provincial Achievement Test (PAT) Acceptable level; Diploma Exam (DIP) Acceptable level; work preparation; citizenship; parental involvement; and continuous school improvement.

 

As an organization dedicated to continuous growth and improvement in student achievement, we invest a lot of effort in evaluating data with our schools to identify focus areas for improvement in the year ahead at both the system and individual school levels. Priorities for this year include:

• Increase PAT and diploma exam results in the excellence category; and
• Increase overall diploma exam participation rate (4+ exams);
• On PATs, increase the standard of excellence level attained at both the grade 6 and 9 levels;
• Improve student achievement in high school Math and Science courses; and

 

There are also several other factors that contribute to student achievement, such as:

• High quality staff and excellent teaching. In this regard we provide our staff with ongoing, strategic professional development aimed at improving student learning and success; and
• A continuing focus on ensuring safe, caring and inclusive learning environments;
• Communicating openly and engaging often with parents regarding their child’s progress.

 

We want to thank our staff, parents and students in Foothills School Division for their ongoing efforts to improve student learning across the division. We also want to assure parents that every decision – whether it concerns classroom teaching and supports or transportation – is made through the lens of how it will improve student learning and success. We look forward to continuing to work in partnership with school families to provide their children with a high quality education and prepare them for their future as contributing members of society and exceptional citizens.

	<title>Winter Weather Safety</title>
	<description>
Safety Reminders for Winter Weather Conditions




Winter weather conditions are forecast this week and parents/guardians are cautioned to take extra care with students traveling to and from school. Please note the following:


	
	All students should be well prepared for conditions caused by low temperatures and high wind chills.  Parents/guardians should ensure their children have suitable outdoor clothing for the lunch hour and scheduled breaks.
	
	
	Cold weather or heavy snowfalls can result in bus schedules being unavoidably delayed. Buses will run as close to schedule as possible, but delays do occur and should be expected.
	
	
	Students should not be left unattended at bus stops. Parents should form an emergency plan with their children so they have clear instructions about what to do if the bus does not arrive.
	
	
	Children should be dressed appropriately for the cold weather. Unexpected mechanical problems may occur which can cause buses to cool off very quickly.
	


During the winter months, it is necessary on occasion to temporarily close a school or schools when weather conditions might endanger the safety of students. The Superintendent of Schools has authority on behalf of the Board, to temporarily close a school or schools. A number of factors go into this decision, including the conditions of: roads near schools, school grounds, school bus routes, and whether facilities are fully operational.  If parents/guardians believe their local conditions are unsafe, they may keep their child at home or arrange for his/her early dismissal.

We strive to keep our schools open to provide a safe, warm and secure environment for attending students.  We advise parents/guardians to check our wesbite if they are uncertain of school closures. Announcements will be clearly posted on the homepage.  Information will also be provided via the radio stations along with the School Division Facebook page and School Division Twitter account.

	<title>Election Reflection: Critical Thinking for students through Current Events</title>
	<description>By: Allen Davidson, Assistant Superintendent

 

A priority for me as a classroom Social Studies teacher for 17 years was to engage students in critical thinking around current events. Part of that engagement involved ensuring we (myself and students) all understood diverse perspectives, were cognizant of our own and others bias, and that we could safely engage in a civil discourse around current events and issues. Time was set aside every week for students to explore issues of interest to them and develop their own opinion on the issue. I loved the diverse opinions students brought to the discussion and the confidence with which they voiced differing perspectives.

 

As part of that ongoing inquiry into issues affecting our world in our classroom we often coordinated multi-candidate panels and debate opportunities when both provincial or local elections were being held. Frequently, MP’s or local MLA’s were invited to our classes to speak with students about their work. Always the discourse between candidates and with students was civil and focused on how government worked to solve issues. I was encouraged when students could see that, beyond the theatre of question period, our politicians did actually engage in civil all party committees and treated each other with the same mutual respect that we were trying to establish with students.

 

Our class would also get a publication called the World Press Review that would publish multiple perspectives on a topic like the War in Iraq for instance from newspapers around the world. The World Press Review would identify if the newspaper was privately or publicly owned and what the political bias of the publication was. It was great way for students to develop their critical thinking skills and consider why an event may be reported differently depending on the publisher.

 

Up until 3 years ago, in my own home, I would get 2 national daily newspapers delivered that would be identified as being more sympathetic to either one side of the political spectrum or the other. I loved the print news for many reasons one being that my young kids would jump on my lap while the weekend paper was on the dining room table and ask questions like Dad who is that? or Dad why are those people holding signs? or Dad where is that volcano? The serendipity of that moment where a child’s interest is peaked just because the story is there is lost now in our world where our particular perspectives or biases are reinforced and directed to our twitter accounts, our Facebook accounts or the other ways we organize for our digital news to be brought to us in the small bits and pieces we expect.

 

Indeed, since I cancelled my print based delivery ($300 - $400 per year, per subscription…. who does that anymore!)  I have relied on news feeds to my twitter account, the 10 free articles I get to read per month on the topics of my choosing, and other news pieces that I haves sought out deliberately. As a result, I have found my own perspective has narrowed, the serendipitous opportunity to have my kids ask me about what’s in the paper has been lost, and I have stopped learning about those things that I would just happen to come across on the next page of the newspaper that the algorithms of digital data bases don’t push to me based on my search history. I also miss the ink that gets all over my hands as I read the weekend edition from front page to back. 

 

As I reflect on the recent election campaign in the United States (and Canada to a lesser extent) I am concerned about the lack of civil discourse and information sharing from different perspectives, that seemed to be present, in media sources I sought out or that were digitally fed to me. It was not consistent with the expectations I had for my classroom where multiple perspectives were sought to help us form thoughtful opinion and develop our own personal perspectives.

 

I encourage everyone in classrooms and homes to develop critical thinking opportunities, for kids, around current events where all voices and perspectives can be expressed.  I am going to renew my subscriptions to a couple of newspapers this weekend and although my kids are now too big to sit on my lap, I hope they leaf through it and ask me questions again when they see it on the dining room table….

	<title>FSD Provincial Assessment Results</title>
	<description>Overall measures related to student learning and achievement in Foothills School Division (FSD) remained strong according to provincial assessment results released by Alberta Education. Superintendent John Bailey says, “The Division is committed to continuous growth and improvement and we have identified focus areas for improvement in the year ahead.”

 

 

Highlights from the 2015-16 year results:


	Receiving an overall rating of excellent and/or surpassed provincial averages:
	
		Program of studies (85.1 % compared to 81.9% provincially);
		Dropout rate (1.9 % compared to 3.2 % provincially);
		Three-year high school completion rate (86.6% compared to 76.5 % provincially);
		PAT Exams – Acceptable standard (76.1% compared to 73.6% provincially);
		Diploma Exams – Acceptable standard (86.8% compared to 85.0% provincially.
		 
	
	
	FSD also performed well on the following measures:
	
		Education quality (89.2 %);
		Safe and caring schools (89.6 %);
		Citizenship (83.1 %);
		Work preparation (80.8 %);
		Parental involvement (81.6 %); and
		Continuous school improvement (79.8 %).
	
	


 

Areas of growth and focus for the 2016-17 school year include:


	Overall PAT results in the excellence category (FSD currently at 15.6%; Province 19.4%);
	Overall Diploma excellence rating (FSD 14.4%; Province 21.0%);
	Overall Diploma exam participation rate – four or more Diploma exams (FSD 50.6%; Province 54.6%);
	PAT exams – increase acceptable standard at the grade 9 level, and standard of excellence at the grade 6 and 9 levels;
	Diploma exams – maintaining and improving on acceptable standards and improving level of excellence in all courses.
	Through a variety of instructional programs, sustaining the emphasis on the development of strong literacy and numeracy skills, which are vital to student success in school, work and life.


The Division continued to see growth in student achievement in 2015-2016, particularly in the acceptable standard relative to provincial achievement results, with 86.8% of high school students writing Diploma Exams achieving the acceptable standard (compared to 85.0% provincially). Other achievement highlights include:


	Provincial Achievement Tests (PATs) in the acceptable range (76.1%) was above the provincial average (73.6%), and there was an increase of results at the excellence level (from 14.5% to 15.6%)
	English Language Arts 30-2 surpassed the provincial average at both the acceptable level (FSD 93.2%; Prov. 89.1%) and excellence level (FSD 14.5%; Prov. 12.3%)
	Mathematics 30-2 surpassed the provincial average at both the acceptable level (FSD 79%; Prov. 75.4%) and excellence level (FSD 22.4%; Prov.16.8%)
	Biology 30 results at both the acceptable and excellence levels improved from the three year average results for FSD (Acc. from 83.2% to 86.4% and Exc. from 27.1% to 28.2%)
	Chemistry 30, Physics 30 and Science 30 results at the acceptable level improved from the three year average results for FSD:
	
		Chem. 30 from 75.8% to 78.3%
		Physics 30 from 74.2% to 85.5%
		Science 30 from 73.2% to 82.3%
	
	


 

“This provincial data is one indicator of how our Division is performing as a whole,” explains Bailey. “We carefully review and evaluate this information with our school administrative teams to identify strategic priorities for the year ahead, at both the system and individual school levels, as part of our focus on continuous improvement. We are committed to improving student success in all of the measures, including provincial exam results.  While we are pleased with much of the work that goes on across FSD, we also recognize that we must continue to work diligently to improve learning for all students, particularly in a number of areas we have identified as areas for growth and focus.  We believe that public education is about providing hope and opportunity for all students, and that means we must pay close attention to areas for improvement and devote effort and resources to see improvement.” Bailey added.

“On behalf of our board, I commend system leaders, school administrators and staff in Foothills for their ongoing efforts to improve student learning across the Division.”  While we see growth and improvement in a number of measures, as a school system we believe that we must always strive to improve,” says Christine Pretty, Chair, FSD Board of Trustees. “We want to focus on providing excellent opportunities for all of our students and provincial results continue to be an important measure for school divisions in Alberta to assess areas of growth and improvement.  We are confident that by working together we can help our students achieve excellence.”

Divisional education plans and annual results reports must be submitted to Alberta Education by the end of November. As part of the process, FSD schools will be working on strategies to improve student learning. In the meantime, for more information about provincial assessment results at your child’s school, please contact the school principal.

	<title>Attendance Matters</title>
	<description>In Foothills School Division we all play a part contributing to building a welcoming, caring, respectful and safe learning environment that respects diversity and fosters a sense of belonging.

To ensure all students are engaged and successful learners, every day in school counts.   Attendance is an essential ingredient to academic success.

School absence adds up.  Non-attendance is a significant early indicator that your child may be at risk for not completing high school.  Chronic absence is defined as missing 10% or more of school for any reason.  Poor attendance is not just about unexcused absences or children willfully skipping school – excused absences can affect performance, too.

Research from the Every Student Counts:  Keeping Kids in School Report indicates that students with attendance challenges typically do not:


	feel safe
	have positive connections or relationships with others
	feel that they belong and/or
	make the effort to attend school regularly


 (Alberta Education; Spring 2014) 

 

School strategies to create a Culture of Attendance include:


	Recognizing Good and Improved Attendance
	Engaging Students and Parents
	Monitoring Attendance Data and Practice
	Providing Personalized Early Support
	Responding to Barriers


 

Parent strategies to create a Culture of Attendance include:    


	Show interest in your child’s schooling by talking with their teachers, helping with homework and overtly encourage them to do well at school. Having regular contact between home and school will help to discourage absenteeism with an early detection system in place before attendance becomes chronic
	Reduce technology distractions at home that make getting to school challenging
	Avoid booking trips during school days wherever possible
	Encourage a healthy lifestyle including good eating and sleeping routines
	Keep open the line of communication talking directly to your child when problems arise for ideas about how things could work better for them at school
	Monitor transportation to ensure there are not concerns around taking the bus, walking, or riding to school
	Encourage your child to join clubs or activities of interest at school to encourage school connection
	Support your child with clear goals for themselves regarding school and future making the connection between your child’s current school experience and their future

Support is Available

If you are experiencing difficulty in having your child attend regularly, there are supports in place for you.  Contact your child’s teacher, administrator of Family School Liaison Counsellor.  They can provide you with strategies and supports to encourage attendance and ensure your child has a successful year at school!  So welcome back to school!

	<title>The Debate over Public Funding for Private Schools</title>
	<description>By Drew Chipman, Assistant Superintendent, Corporate Services

There has been quite a bit of back and forth in the news lately regarding public funding of private schools and whether or not the Government of Alberta should continue to provide them with funding. There are arguments on both sides of the issue: those arguing that it takes dollars away from public education and those stating that it saves money because if those students were in the public system they would be 100% funded vs. the 60 or 70% private schools receive.  Another pro-private school funding argument is that private schools provide more “choice” and that taking away funding diminishes that option for families interested in a private school education for their children.

Private schools wishing to access provincial funding must fit within two different classes to qualify for provincial support: Level 1 funded private schools have to follow basic reporting requirements and government oversight to obtain 60% funding.  Level 2 funded private schools agree to additional scrutiny by fully participating in the provincial accountability program and, once accepted as a Level 2 school must stay at that level in order to receive 70% funding.

So, how many students are attending private schools in Alberta?  One report written in 2015 by Van Pelt, Nevins, Brown and Palacios1 revealed that in 2013 there were slightly less than 25,000 private school students out of more than 619,000 students, or 3.9% of the student population. This number, while not insignificant, is the second lowest of all but the Maritime provinces according to the same report. Between 2001-2013, private school attendance increased as a percentage of total student population in every province except Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick; this despite the fact that many of these provinces have not increased contributions to private schools.

In Alberta, private schools were funded at 50% of public school funding until 1998 when it was increased to 60%. In 2008, private schools received another increase to 70% for those schools agreeing to the Level 2 certification. In both instances, public schools and their boards had little input into the changes. Currently, the Alberta School Boards Association is asking the provincial government to redirect the approximately $248 million dollars paid to private schools into public education.

A website, www.ourkids.net, states that private schools in Alberta charge between $5,000 and $50,000 a year for tuition. If you look at what Foothills School Division receives from the province each year per student, approximately $10,900 through a variety of grants (based on our 2014/15 Audited Financial Statement), you can see that the addition of provincial funding (up to 70% of public school funding) can give private schools a significant leg up on what they have to spend per student compared to public schools.

Along with the fact that private schools receive provincial funding over and above tuition charged, it is important to note that private schools set the criteria for enrolment. For example, they can accept or turn away students with physical or learning disabilities. While public education in the province celebrates its diversity and the fact that we are inclusive of all students, the public, government and private sectors often compare our student results to those of our private school counterparts. It is not an “apples to apples” comparison.

The argument that if the government doesn’t provide funding to private schools those students will come back to the public systems and then the province will have to provide full funding for all 25,000 private schools students may seem to make sense on the surface. The  reasoning goes on to say that if private students are added back into the system it will then reduce the amount of funding available per student across the province.  However, if Ontario is any indication, this is certainly not the case. They have a significantly higher number of private schools and students (both in raw numbers and as a percentage of total student population) and yet they provide no provincial funding for private schools. One can surmise that those desiring a private school education for their children are not motivated by the amount of provincial funding private schools receive, or lack thereof.

Foothills School Division is certainly in favour of educational choice for students and families. However, we are not sure that choice means provincial funding for private schools should have to accompany that determination.  In fact, FSD trustees recently passed a motion “in favour of a funding model that fully supports our public education system and does not diminish or erode funding from public education in Alberta.”

With all of this information in hand, perhaps it’s time that the Province reviewed its stance on the continued funding of private schools.
